# Alternative-code-of-Introduction-chapter-of-Joel-Grus-Data-Science-from-Scratch-

This is my take on the code used in the Introduction's project of the seminal book "Data Science from Scratch".
It's written in Python. I found the original code rather convoluted, with heavy use of dictionaries rendering the whole project rather obscure.
